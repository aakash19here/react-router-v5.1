# React Router v5.1

Just type `npm install` in your terminal and all the packages will be installed 

To start the app , type `npm start`, it will start your website on localhost 

To Fetch the data you must start your json server using `json-server --watch <file_path>` 
For example in my case it is `json-server --watch ./data/db.json`

After the database is up and running you are good to go

For now it cannot fetch data cause I haven't hosted my database yet :(
